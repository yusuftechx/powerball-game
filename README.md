<h1>Hi, I am YusuftechX!</h1>

<h2>This is my Powerball Lottery Simulation</h2>

<p>This Python project simulates the thrill of playing the Powerball Lottery without spending any money. It provides a hands-on experience with probability, user interaction, and Python programming, showcasing various programming concepts and techniques.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The <strong>Powerball Lottery Simulation</strong> is designed to demonstrate Python programming skills in a real-world context. It enables players to select numbers, simulate multiple lottery draws, and experience the outcomes—all while adhering to the rules of the real Powerball Lottery.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Interactive user input for selecting numbers and Powerball.</li>
        <li>Simulates up to 1,000,000 lottery draws.</li>
        <li>Realistic validation for lottery rules:
            <ul>
                <li>5 unique numbers between 1 and 69.</li>
                <li>Powerball number between 1 and 26.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Exit functionality at any prompt for user convenience.</li>
        <li>Play-again feature for multiple rounds in a single session.</li>
        <li>Comprehensive error handling for invalid inputs.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Project Highlights</h2>
<p>This project demonstrates proficiency in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Python Basics</strong>: Variables, input/output, and flow control.</li>
        <li><strong>Functions</strong>: Modular code design with reusable functions like <code>get_player_numbers()</code> and <code>simulate_lottery()</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: Graceful handling of invalid inputs with <code>try-except</code> blocks.</li>
        <li><strong>Randomization</strong>: Using <code>random.shuffle()</code> and <code>random.randint()</code> for realistic lottery number generation.</li>
        <li><strong>User Interaction</strong>: Clean and user-friendly prompts for inputs and outputs.</li>
        <li><strong>Code Readability</strong>: Well-documented code with descriptive comments and structured logic.</li>
    </ul>

 <h2>Functions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><code>get_player_numbers()</code>: Prompts the player to enter 5 unique numbers between 1 and 69.</li>
        <li><code>get_powerball_number()</code>: Prompts the player to select a Powerball number between 1 and 26.</li>
        <li><code>get_number_of_plays()</code>: Allows the player to specify how many times to simulate the lottery.</li>
        <li><code>simulate_lottery()</code>: Runs the lottery simulation, generates winning numbers, and checks for matches.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The player selects 5 unique numbers (1-69) and a Powerball number (1-26).</li>
        <li>The player specifies how many times they want to play.</li>
        <li>The program simulates the lottery and compares the player's numbers with randomly generated winning numbers.</li>
        <li>The result of each simulation is displayed, including a message for winning or losing.</li>
        <li>The player can choose to play again or exit the program.</li>
    </ol>

<h2>Example Interaction</h2>
<pre>
Enter 5 different numbers from 1 to 69, separated by spaces (or type 'exit' to quit):
5 12 23 34 45
Enter the Powerball number (between 1 and 26, or type 'exit' to quit):
15
How many times do you want to play? (Max: 1,000,000, or type 'exit' to quit):
3

It costs $6 to play 3 times. Good luck!
Press Enter to start (or type 'exit' to quit at any time)...

Winning numbers: 8, 12, 23, 34, 45 and Powerball 16
Winning numbers: 1, 3, 23, 35, 50 and Powerball 15

Sorry, you lost.
You have wasted $6. Thanks for playing!
